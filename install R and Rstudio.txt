//Install R

sudo apt-get dist-upgrade
sudo apt-get upgrade

sudo su
echo "deb http://cran.rstudio.com/bin/linux/ubuntu trusty/" >> /etc/apt/sources.list
apt-key adv --keyserver keyserver.ubuntu.com --recv-keys E084DAB9
apt-get update
apt-get install r-base
// R ( This is for R command prompt)



//Install R Studio
//http://benedikt-heller.de/bh/using-rstudio-on-amazon-aws/
//After Microsoft R has been installed, you prepare the RStudio Server installation
sudo useradd rstudio
sudo mkdir /home/rstudio
sudo passwd rstudio
sudo chmod -R 0777 /home/rstudio

//Next, the operating system should be updated. This has proven to prevent errors later on
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get upgrade

//Now we can finally install RStudio Server:

sudo apt-get install gdebi-core
sudo wget "https://download2.rstudio.org/rstudio-server-0.99.903-amd64.deb"
sudo gdebi rstudio-server-0.99.903-amd64.deb

//I also recommend you install these compilers, which will enable you to install R packages:

sudo apt-get install g++
sudo apt-get install make
sudo apt-get install gfortran


Alright. If you have followed the above steps, your AWS instance with Microsoft R should be up and running.
 You can access RStudio by pasting the public DNS into your browser, but make sure to add :8787 
to the address, which designates the port of RStudio. When you see the login dialog, enter 
the account details you have specified earlier (I set up user rstudio with password rstudio).
